### Credits:

- Credits to the [FaithfulPack Team](https://faithfulpack.net/), since I imported the majority of all vanilla textures for Et Futurum Requiem from there. Specifically from their [Classic Faithful Branch](https://github.com/ClassicFaithful/Classic-32x-Java/)

- Credits to Magnetanide for her excellent block textures from the pack [Stellar Fusion](https://web.archive.org/web/20230430014009/https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/forum/m/36844562/viewthread/32547244-stellar-fusion-gregtech-32x32-v034) - Archive Link
